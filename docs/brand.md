## Typography (confirmed)

Three typefaces — each has a specific role:

| Font | Role | Load via |
|---|---|---|
| **Anton** | Headings / Display — H1, H2, hero text | `next/font/google` |
| **Inter Tight** | Body, UI, labels, buttons, nav | `next/font/google` |
| **Caramel** | Charged brand moments only — the "c" in the logo, special branded type treatments | Self-host (not on Google Fonts) |

### Usage rules
- **Anton** — big, bold, impactful. For section headings and hero statements. Uppercase where appropriate.
- **Inter Tight** — everything else. Body copy, nav links, button labels, form fields, metadata.
- **Caramel** — use very sparingly. Only for moments where the "Charged" brand identity needs to show up typographically (logo, branded callouts). Not for body copy.

### Scale
| Role | Font | Mobile | Desktop | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hero / Display | Anton | `text-5xl` | `text-8xl` | 400 (Anton is inherently bold) |
| H1 | Anton | `text-4xl` | `text-6xl` | 400 |
| H2 | Anton | `text-3xl` | `text-5xl` | 400 |
| H3 | Inter Tight | `text-2xl` | `text-3xl` | 600–700 |
| Body | Inter Tight | `text-base` | `text-lg` | 400 |
| Label / Tag | Inter Tight | `text-xs` | `text-sm` | 500, uppercase, tracking-wider |
| CTA Button | Inter Tight | `text-sm` | `text-sm` | 700, uppercase, tracking-widest |

## Logo

**Primary logo:** "charged" wordmark — lowercase, with the "c" rendered in Caramel font at `#FFC100` yellow. Remaining letters in near-black or white depending on background.

**Logomark:** Lightning bolt / "charged" symbol — the diagonal slash motif in `#FFC100`. Exists in single, double, and combined-with-wordmark variants.

- **Light version (on dark bg):** White wordmark + yellow "c" + yellow lightning bolt
- **Dark version (on light bg):** Black wordmark + yellow "c" + yellow lightning bolt

**Export required:**
- `/public/logo.svg` — light version (for dark backgrounds — primary use)
- `/public/logo-dark.svg` — dark version (for light backgrounds)
- `/public/logomark.svg` — lightning bolt symbol only
- `/public/favicon.ico` + `/public/icon.svg`

**Minimum size:** 120px wide. Clear space = height of the "c" on all sides.

## Visual Style

- **Aesthetic:** Dark, electric, premium. The yellow accent brings energy — use it purposefully, not everywhere.
- **Background:** `#020413` base. `#171E3A` for layered surfaces/cards.
- **Imagery:** Real project work only. Mockups of delivered sites. No stock.
- **Motion:** Smooth, intentional. The brand has energy — animations should feel alive but never chaotic.
- **The lightning bolt motif:** The diagonal slash/bolt is a core visual element. Use as decorative background texture, section dividers, or large abstract shapes — always in `#FFC100` at low opacity or full.
