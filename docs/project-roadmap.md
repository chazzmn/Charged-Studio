# Project Roadmap — Charged Studio Website

> The full plan from zero to live. Update status as phases complete.

---

## Current State (last updated 2026-06-23)

**Build:** Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind v4. All core pages + homepage skeleton built and type-checking clean. Deployed to Vercel; pushing to `main` auto-deploys.

**Done:** Scaffold, brand tokens, all 3 fonts (Caramel self-hosted), Nav/Footer/Container, full homepage (Hero, WorkMarquee, Services, ValueProp, FeaturedWork, Testimonials, FAQ, CTA), pages (`/about`, `/contact`, `/start-a-project`, `/audit`, `/devon-nurseries`, `/blog` + 5 posts, `/privacy`, `/terms-of-service`), and a working lead-capture form (`/api/contact` → Resend/Formspree).

**Confirmed decisions:** Reposition to websites-led (software/SEO added, branding demoted). Site's job = lead gen. ICP = local Devon/SW service businesses. Primary CTA = project form; Free Audit secondary; Book-a-call tertiary. Blog = footer-only (SEO), not nav. Case studies: Devon Nurseries = flagship; CHAZZMN deferred; The Unaffiliated dropped.

**Theme decision (2026-06-23 — REVERTED TO DARK):** Charlie trialled a light theme then reversed it — the site is back **DARK**: `#020413` page background, `#F7F7F7` primary text, yellow `#FFC100` the single accent, navy `#171E3A` surfaces. This now **matches the canonical `BRAND-SYSTEM.md`** (which always read dark), so no reconciliation pass is needed. Implemented by flipping `:root` semantic tokens + dark-tuned shadows in `globals.css` and reversing the literal theme classes across all pages/components (page text → `charged-light`, cards → `bg-charged-navy/40`, borders → `border-white/x`, gradients + marquee edge-fades → dark). Nav + Footer were already dark bookends. Chatbot re-skinned to dark. tsc clean; Tailwind compiles. (Light-theme work is recoverable in git history if ever wanted again.)

**AI chat bot (2026-06-23 — NEW):** Simple floating chat button, bottom-right, answers general visitor questions. Charlie has existing working code (currently live on chargedstudio.co.uk) to reuse. Scoped as a port/reuse, not a new build.

**Next up:** Direction lock (light theme + hero) → **Phase 3.5 design pass & IA v2** (apply light theme, remove emojis, hero video, scrolling reviews, per-service pages, contact redesign, about-process, AI bot) → SEO/technical wiring (sitemap + robots, Organization JSON-LD, GA4, OG image) → go-live (domain/DNS, verify Resend, cancel Framer).

**Pending on Charlie:** visual design (post-course); supply real images (pull from Framer). ~~verify domain in Resend~~ ✅ done. ~~legally review Privacy/Terms~~ ✅ done.

**Confirmed by Charlie 2026-06-24:** Resend domain verified + forms tested working; Privacy/Terms legally reviewed; Google Search Console set up (will be **connected at go-live**, not before).

**Pre-launch cleanups (last-minute, before go-live):**
- **Services section visuals** — UPDATE 2026-06-24: each row now shows its matching **coded graphic** (shared with the hero: Website / SEO / Software / Branding from `components/graphics.tsx`), not photos. These are the intended visuals now; real photos optional later if wanted.
- Build/added 2026-06-24: new **`WhyCharged`** trust section sits between the work marquee and Services (founder-led · APM PMQ · local · ongoing). No imagery needed (icon-led), but copy is final-draft — review before go-live.

---

## NEXT SESSION — confirmed requirements (Charlie, 2026-06-23) — NOT yet built

These are the agreed next jobs. Do these, then push (Charlie said "we're very close to a finished product").

1. ~~**Start a Project → LONG MULTI-STEP FORM.**~~ ✅ **DONE 2026-06-24.** New `components/ProjectWizard.tsx` — 4-step wizard with progress bar, per-step validation, back/continue, success state: (1) what you need (service multi-select) → (2) your project (type + description + current URL) → (3) budget & timeline → (4) about you (name/email/business/phone). Wired into `app/start-a-project/page.tsx` (replaced the short `ProjectForm`; **`/contact` still uses the short `ProjectForm kind="project"` — left untouched on purpose**). Posts to `/api/contact` kind=project; route extended with `services, projectType, budget, timeline, phone`. ⏳ Field lists (services, budget tiers £1k–£10k+, timelines) are **proposed defaults — Charlie to tweak** (esp. budget ranges vs his pricing). tsc clean.
2. ~~**Audit feature — REDESIGN TO MATCH CHARLIE'S REFERENCE PHOTO.**~~ ✅ **DONE 2026-06-24.** Direction confirmed = **redesigned request form** (NOT an automated/instant audit). Reference received. Rebuilt `app/audit/page.tsx`: centred row of topic pills (Page Speed · SEO Basics · Mobile · Broken Links · Social Presence · Branding · AEO, each with a check icon) + a dark card "REQUEST YOUR AUDIT". New `components/AuditForm.tsx` (client): first/last name, email, company/brand, website URL (globe icon), industry `<select>`, a 2×2 "biggest challenge" selector (Not enough traffic / Low conversions / Looks outdated / Not sure — just want a review), optional notes, "Request my audit →" submit. Posts to `/api/contact` kind=audit; route extended with `industry` + `challenge` fields in the email. Added `CheckCircle` to `components/icons.tsx`. tsc clean. (Old `/audit` used `ProjectForm kind="audit"` — that branch is now unused by /audit but ProjectForm still serves the project flow.)
3. ~~**Services section (homepage `components/Services.tsx`) — "not good", needs a redesign.**~~ ✅ **DONE 2026-06-24.** Rebuilt as a "pinned scroll" pattern (ref: cbwebsitedesign.co.uk, Charlie's pick): per-service row with the title + "Explore →" CTA sticky on the left (lg+) while a visual + native `<details>` accordion of the service's feature points scroll past on the right. Mix of visuals per Charlie: real screenshots for Websites (dn-home) + Branding (chazzmn), branded bolt/numeral panels for SEO + Software. Now imports the single source of truth `app/services/services-data.ts` (removed the duplicate SERVICES array). Fully responsive — collapses to single-column, sticky off, tap-friendly accordions on mobile. Added `Chevron` to icons.tsx. tsc clean; Tailwind compiles. Copy/structure are fine; it's the visual treatment.
4. ~~**About page redesign — match Charlie's reference layout + add HIM.**~~ ✅ **DONE 2026-06-24.** Founder hero in `app/about/page.tsx`: big name "Charlie Norona", subtitle "Founder & Creative Director", founder cut-out (`/images/charlie-norona.png`, web-sized 800px from `public/content/Charlie Norona.png`) on a yellow circle (left), bio paragraphs leading on the **APM PMQ** USP (right), stat row (**APM PMQ** · **100%** · **Exeter**), and a circular "CONTACT →" button → `/contact`. Process + Values sections retained below. tsc clean. ⏳ Charlie to eyeball the cut-out's vertical fit inside the circle on `npm run dev` (object-bottom; tweak the `top-10` inset if the head sits too high/low).
5. ~~**BUG: Denise Russell missing from the reviews marquee.**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-06-24.** She was rendering all along (initials fallback) — the real gap was no headshot. Charlie supplied one as JXL; converted to `public/images/testimonials/denise-russell.jpg` (200×267, via pillow-jxl-plugin since ImageMagick has no JXL delegate) and wired into her entry in `components/Testimonials.tsx`. Original JXL removed. tsc clean. (Ivan still has a photo but no quote — unused, left as-is.)

### Already DONE this session (2026-06-23, code; verify with `npm run dev`)
- **Theme reverted to DARK** + **full semantic-token migration** (re-theme now = edit `app/globals.css` `:root` only).
- **Nav reverted** to transparent-over-hero → translucent `bg-bg/80 backdrop-blur-md` on scroll (was a solid attention-drawing bar). `components/Nav.tsx`.
- **Testimonial headshots wired in.** Files copied to `public/images/testimonials/` (kebab-named): tariq-salfo.jpg, jane-gold.png, jack-smith.png, olivia-johnson.png (+ ivan.jpg unused). `components/Testimonials.tsx` now renders `next/image` with an initials fallback. ⚠️ **Denise Russell has no headshot; Ivan has a photo but no quote** — Charlie to decide (add a Denise photo, or give Ivan a quote and swap). Originals live in `public/content/testimonial headshots/`.

## Phase 3.5 — Design Pass & IA v2 (CURRENT FOCUS — added 2026-06-23)

Distilled from Charlie's design notes. Gated by the direction lock (light theme + hero concept).

| Task | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Lock direction:** light theme confirmed (`#F7F7F7`); confirm hero concept (full-bleed bg video vs split video-right/black-left) + mobile behaviour | Charlie | 🟡 Theme ✅ light; hero concept TBC |
| Reconcile `BRAND-SYSTEM.md` with the theme | Claude | ✅ N/A — site reverted to DARK (2026-06-23), which already matches BRAND-SYSTEM.md. No reconciliation needed. |
| ~~Apply light theme~~ → **REVERTED to dark** across all pages/components (tokens, surfaces, borders, gradients, chatbot) | Claude | ✅ Done — light trial reversed; :root tokens + literal classes flipped back to dark; tsc clean, Tailwind compiles |
| **Semantic-token migration** — replace ALL hardcoded colour classes (`bg-charged-*`, `text-charged-*`, `*-white`) with role tokens (`bg-bg`, `bg-surface`, `text-text`, `text-text-inverse`, `border-border`, `text-accent`, etc.). Makes re-theming a one-file edit. | Claude | ✅ Done 2026-06-23 — 0 literal colour classes remain in app/components; opacity preserved (`text-text/70`); tsc clean, Tailwind compiles. **Re-theme = edit `app/globals.css` `:root` only.** Note: nav/footer/chatbot now flip WITH the theme (no permanent dark bookends — re-add as a deliberate override if wanted). |
| **Remove ALL emojis** (⚡ in Services, audit-form icons) → bolt-motif SVG or thin line icons | Claude | ✅ Done — `components/icons.tsx` (BoltMark + SVG Stars); zero emojis remain |
| Hero visual | Claude | ✅ **DONE 2026-06-24** — Charlie's concept: the browser-frame mockup **loops a 5-scene Charged story**: "Coming soon" → Website builds in → SEO/ranking → Software/dashboard → Branding → repeat (each staggers in). Scene graphics extracted to **`components/graphics.tsx`** (`WebsiteGraphic`, `SearchGraphic`, `SoftwareGraphic`, `BrandingGraphic` + shared `gContainer`/`gBlock`) and **shared with the services rows**. `components/HeroMockup.tsx` drives the loop (framer-motion; reduced-motion holds the Website scene). Pure code, no asset/video. Branding mark uses the **bolt** (the "c" was messy — removed). |
| Scrolling reviews (testimonial marquee) | Claude | ✅ Done — Testimonials = pausable marquee, edge fades, reduced-motion fallback |
| Trust signals: 5-star Google rating badge + social connectors | Claude | ✅ Done — real figures (5.0 / 16 Google reviews) in reviews header; socials in footer |
| Restyle Privacy + Terms into properly designed pages | Claude | ⬜ |
| **Separate page per service** (Websites, Software/Apps, SEO, Branding) — SEO play, real copy each | Claude | ✅ Done — `/services` hub + `/services/[slug]` (data in `app/services/services-data.ts`). Per-page metadata + FAQPage JSON-LD + cross-links; wired into Nav, footer, homepage cards. Also fixed flip bug: mobile hamburger lines were invisible (`bg-charged-light`→`bg-charged-black`) |
| Contact page redesign: quick get-in-touch form + "Book a free consultation" (reframe from "call") + contact details (number/email/location) + button to Start-a-Project form | Claude | ✅ Done |
| About page: add a process section (lean on APM / PM background) | Claude | ✅ Done — "How we work / Structured, not chaotic", 4 steps |
| **Chat bot** — floating button bottom-right, general Q&A; port existing code from chargedstudio.co.uk | Claude | 🟡 INTERIM — ported + improved (`components/Chatbot.tsx`, site-wide). **Charlie: "will do for now" but flagged it must be REDEVELOPED before the site is delivered.** Likely path: AI-backed (`/api/chat` + LLM key) and/or richer flows. Do NOT ship as-is. |
| Consolidate image assets (currently `public/Imagary/`, `content/` empty) + clean filenames | Claude/Charlie | ⬜ |

---

## Phase 4 — Polish & QA

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| Mobile responsiveness — every page, every breakpoint | ⬜ |
| Animations — all sections have entrance animations | 🟡 Framer Motion entrances on built sections (reduced-motion safe). Revisit during design pass |
| Contact form — connected to Resend / email delivery tested | ✅ **DONE 2026-06-24** — Resend domain verified, forms send + deliver correctly (contact, audit, and the new project wizard all post to /api/contact → Resend). |
| `sitemap.xml` | ✅ **DONE 2026-06-24** — native `app/sitemap.ts` (generated from services + blog data, never drifts). **Switched away from `next-sitemap`** (no postbuild needed; dep now unused, safe to remove later). |
| `robots.txt` | ✅ **DONE 2026-06-24** — native `app/robots.ts`: allow all **including AI/answer-engine crawlers** (GPTBot/ClaudeBot/PerplexityBot/Google-Extended) for AEO; references sitemap + host. |
| JSON-LD structured data | ✅ **DONE 2026-06-24** — site-wide Organization+ProfessionalService+WebSite graph (`lib/structured-data.ts` via `components/JsonLd.tsx` in layout): address (Exeter/Devon), areaServed, socials (sameAs), founder Charlie Norona w/ **APM PMQ credential**, 5.0/16 aggregateRating, knowsAbout. Homepage **FAQPage** schema (shared `app/faq-data.ts`). Service pages already have FAQPage; blog posts have BlogPosting. **AEO:** added `public/llms.txt`; set `<html lang="en-GB">`. **OG share image** ✅ generated `public/og-image.jpg` (1200×630, branded — wordmark on dark + glow; already referenced in layout metadata). |
| All pages have unique metadata (title + description) | ✅ Every built page has metadata + canonical |
| All images have `alt` text | 🟡 Placeholders are divs; applies once real images go in |
| All images using `next/image` | 🟡 Logo uses next/image; section images are placeholder divs until real assets |
| Lighthouse score 95+ on all pages | ⬜ (run + add the real score as a homepage proof point) |
| Cross-browser test: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge | ⬜ |
| `npm run build` passes with zero errors | ✅ Verified green (Turbopack); tsc clean |

---

## Phase 5 — Go Live

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| Add `chargedstudio.co.uk` to Vercel project | ⬜ |
| Get Vercel DNS records (A record or nameservers) | ⬜ |
| Update DNS at domain registrar → point to Vercel | ⬜ |
| Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48h) | ⬜ |
| Confirm SSL certificate issued by Vercel | ⬜ |
| Test all pages on live domain | ⬜ |
